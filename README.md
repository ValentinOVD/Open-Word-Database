# Open-Word-Database
  
A project for creating a big dictionnary which contains all languages !

# How to help ?

  
 - Add all english word you know using botscript.sh (launch the script by using ./botscript.sh)  
 and Send us the bot.pot created with the script
 Thanks for the help :)
 - You can translate the english words on Transifex : https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/database/
  
  
# How to test ?
  You can test Open Word Database by using the translation script and the fr.po located in this branch (The ja.po, fr.po, mt.po, de.po and ru.po located in the botupload branch should also worked).  

  Example (where computer is the word to translate) :
  - ./translation.sh fr computer
  - The result is ordinateur (the french word of computer).
