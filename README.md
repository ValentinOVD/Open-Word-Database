# Open-Word-Database
  
A project for creating a big dictionnary which contains all languages !

# How to help ?
  
  
 - Add all english word you know using botscript.sh (launch the script by using ./botscript.sh)  
 - Send us the bot.pot created with the script :)  
 Thanks for the help :)

NEXT STEP, NOT YET :
You can translate words on Transifex : https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/database/
  
  
TODO :
A web front-end and a IRC Bot for add word.
